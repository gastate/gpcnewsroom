  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Georgia Perimeter College was designated No. 2 in the nation as "Best for Vets" among two-year colleges in the Military Times magazine's annual ranking.</p>
<p>In its sixth year, the rankings factor in the results of Military Times’ annual survey, the most comprehensive school-by-school assessment of veteran and military student services and rates of academic achievement.</p>
<p>As with all Best for Vets rankings, Best for Vets: Colleges 2016 is an editorially independent news project that evaluates the factors that help make colleges and universities a good fit for service members, military veterans and their families. More than 600 colleges took part in this year’s detailed survey.</p>
<p>"We are certainly honored and thrilled to have been selected as a top Military Times/Best for Vets school," said Mark Eister, director of GPC's Military Outreach program. "Every one of GPC's Military Outreach Center staff works very hard in serving our more than 1,200 military-connected students each semester. We recognize the sacrifices that our military and their families have endured. They had our backs while serving the nation, now we have theirs."</p>
<p>“It’s been amazing to witness how colleges all across higher education have embraced service members and their families,” said Amanda Miller, editor of Military Times’ Best for Vets rankings and special editions. “Over the past six years of our surveys, we’ve seen so many schools first begin to foster – through new policies, services and dedicated facilities—and then nurture these wonderful communities.”</p>
<p>Military Times’ annual Best for Vets: Colleges survey asks colleges and universities to meticulously document a tremendous array of services, special rules, accommodations and financial incentives offered to students with military ties; and to describe many aspects of veteran culture on a campus. Military Times also factors in data from the Veterans Affairs and Defense Departments, as well as three Education Department sources: the IPEDS Data Center, College Scorecard data and the Cohort Default Rate Database.</p>
<p>“We award the Best for Vets designation to the very best—the colleges that really are setting the example,” Miller said.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Peter brings a wealth of academic and administrative experience to this position,” said Risa Palm, Georgia State provost and senior vice president for academic affairs.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Lyons has spearheaded the university’s move to a single authoritative data system, redesigned the academic program review and administrative unit review processes and led the university through various accreditation-related initiatives. He was interim dean of the Byrdine F. Lewis School of Nursing and Health Professions and developed and coordinated the consolidation plan for GPC and Georgia State. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Peter is passionate about Perimeter’s mission and looks forward to working with his colleagues to make this consolidation a stunning success,” said President Mark Becker. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Lyons joined the Georgia State faculty in 1998 as an assistant professor in the School of Social Work and became a full professor in 2011.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">He received his Ph.D. in social work from SUNY Buffalo, and earned his master’s degree in social work and advanced diploma in education at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom. </span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">With the vote of the Board of Regents in January 2016, Perimeter College will officially become an academic unit within Georgia State. The Regents approved consolidation of the two institutions in January 2015.</span></span></p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Just in time for Halloween—it’s Zombie Prom time.</p>
<p>Take a 1950s-style musical, and a comic book love of all things zombie. What you get is the Theatre Arts Guild’s fall production of the “spooktacular” musical, “Zombie Prom,” which opens Friday, Oct. 30 at Georgia Perimeter College's Cole Auditorium on Clarkston Campus. And, in the spirit of the season, theatergoers are encouraged to dress in their favorite costume to compete in a costume contest for the Oct. 31 performance. (Zombie attire is encouraged, but not required.)</p>
<p>Directed by J. Ashley Butler, "Zombie Prom" centers on the relationship of a pretty high school senior and her “bad boy” boyfriend, who takes his motorcycle for a spin into the town’s nuclear waste dump, and comes back to her “glowing.”  He still wants to take her to the prom.  </p>
<p>In her director's notes, Butler says, "What do you get when you combine the paranoia of the nuclear '50s, the myopic view of teenage love and the inconvenience of turning into a zombie right before prom? You get "Zombie Prom."  We hope you'll enjoy our little romp through musical madness as we unfold the story of Jonny and Toffee and their ill-fated romance. And remember, zombies are people, too.  Or at least, they <em>were</em>."</p>
<p>The production is based on the off-Broadway play based on a story by John Dempsey and Hugh M. Murphy, with music by Dana P. Rowe. The GPC production is choreographed by Misty Barber, with music directed by Patrick Hutchison.</p>
<p>The play is at 8 p.m. Oct. 30-31 and Nov. 7, with 3 p.m. shows Sunday, Nov. 1 and Nov. 8. Tickets are free for GPC ID holders, with general admission tickets $20; $15 for 55 and over, and $5 for non-GPC students. The production is suggested for children ages 8 and older. Neither infants nor toddlers will be admitted.</p>
<p>The Cole Auditorium is in the Fine Arts Building, 555 North Indian Creek Drive, Clarkston.</p>

<p>Georgia Perimeter’s Dunwoody Campus will be the first stop in metro Atlanta for a compelling artistic exhibit on human trafficking. The exhibit, “What You See is Not Who I Am” is a 12-panel work of art and information on modern day slavery, developed by student artists in the Groundswell Community Mural Project in New York City who learned how human trafficking is not something that only happens in other places.  With its substantial immigrant and refugee population, Georgia is considered a major destination for U.S. human trafficking, according the Center for Public Policy Studies.</p>
<p>The mural will be on view outdoors on the Dunwoody Campus quad Thursday, Nov. 5 through Tuesday, Nov. 10. The traveling mural comes to the college as part of a partnership with the International Human Trafficking Institute and Art Works for Freedom</p>
<p>There will be a screening of two short films on human trafficking Thursday, Nov. 5 from 2:30 p.m. to 4 p.m.in NC1100. The films, “Fields of Mudan” and “Beyond Borders,” will be shown. A representative from the International Human Trafficking Institute will speak about their work and answer questions.</p>
<p>The International Human Trafficking Institute supports and collaborates with student groups in their preparation for and execution of direct action to end all forms of human trafficking. They are affiliated with the Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta.  You can see a video of how the mural was made on the last slide at this link <a href="http://groundswellmural.org/project/what-you-see-not-who-i-am" target="_blank">http://groundswellmural.org/project/what-you-see-not-who-i-am</a></p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Flu shots are available now at no cost to Georgia Perimeter College students—and to faculty and staff for $10. The GPC <a href="http://depts.gpc.edu/~gpcshc/" target="_blank">Student Health Center</a> will administer the vaccines on a walk-in basis through Sept. 18 and then again in October for a couple of weeks. </p>
<p>“We’re hoping to use all of them,” Suzanne Wetter, GPC Student Health Center director, says of the 700 flu vaccines Georgia Perimeter has in stock.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2015-2016.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine to everyone six months of age and older, noting that it’s difficult to predict severity levels for any flu season. Still, Wetter stresses it’s best to err on the side of caution. “Not only are you protecting yourself, but you’re protecting other people around you,” she says.</p>
<p>This year’s flu vaccine is aimed at guarding against the most common viruses: influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B. The CDC estimates that manufacturers will provide between 171-179 million doses of vaccine for the U.S. market during this flu season, which peaks December through February.</p>
<p>Although Georgia Perimeter will administer more shots in October, Wetter says getting immunized in September is best. “Flu season starts in October and it takes two weeks for you to develop immunity,” she says. </p>
<p>Visit the GPC Student Health Center website for a <a href="http://depts.gpc.edu/~gpcshc/">flu vaccine schedule</a>, which includes health center mobile unit visits to Alpharetta, Decatur and Newton campuses and clinic times at Dunwoody and Clarkston.</p>

A massive regrading and resurfacing project of all the lower parking lots will limit parking options on campus.</p>
<p>But the project should be completed before classes begin on Aug. 17, says Todd Cook, GPC interim director of planning and projects.</p>
<p>The areas currently under construction and closed are Lots 2 and 3 and the eastern and western drives, with entrances on Clifton Springs Road. Parking during this time is available in Lot 1 in front of the SF building and in Lot 5, near the GPC Botanical Gardens off of Panthersville Road.</p>
<p>The $800,000 project will replace an estimated seven acres of paving, says Cook.</p>
<p>“We anticipate that the first phase of the project will be completed before the first day of fall semester classes,” Cook says. “If this goal is achieved, there will be more than ample parking for students, faculty and staff. In the event that the first phase is not completed, a contingency plan has been devised and will be implemented to provide the additional spaces needed for parking.”</p>
<p>The project should also improve storm water drainage with the goal of no ponding water after a rain storm. In addition, the tennis courts, which are currently in a state of disrepair, will be replaced with grass, creating a new green space on campus.</p>

<p>It might be a favorite site -- the botanical gardens at Decatur, backstage at Clarkston’s Cole Auditorium or inside the observatory at Dunwoody. What about the winning athletic teams over the years, Marvin Cole’s performances of Mark Twain or Rob Watts’ bowties?</p>

<p>Some of the sessions are designed to guide managers and supervisors through the process of leading during change and connecting with disengaged staffers—while others, targeting non-management employees, will address managing stress and thriving during change and transition.</p>
<p>“We would like to fill each session,” says Patrice Masterson, GPC human resources director.</p>
<p>The sessions will be held in various locations at Georgia State and on each of Georgia Perimeter’s five campuses and its Lakeside Center. Workshops are free, and participants can attend sessions anywhere they’re offered.

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Georgia Perimeter College alumnus Gangadhar Timilsina is progressing with plans to rebuild schools in his home country of Nepal, where a major earthquake damaged property and killed thousands in April. Within days, Timilsina—an Atlanta software engineer and Georgia Tech grad student—had launched a fundraising campaign to begin the process of reconstructing shattered schools, including one in the north central Nepalese village of Chapakot.</p>
<p>“The reconstruction work has started, where necessary items like cement, sand, bricks, rods, windows and doors [have] reached the location,” Timilsina says.</p>
<p>To date, the campaign has raised $17,000 of its $100,000 goal. “With the current budget, we can only construct one school,” he says. “But we would like to rebuild many more.” Timilsina encourages more people to make a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/helpingnepalese" target="_blank">tax-deductible donation</a> through the Greater Atlanta Vedic Temple relief campaign.</p>
<p>“Temple’s members have strong connections in Nepal and can guarantee that every penny will directly reach those in need,” he says.</p>
<p>Those preferring to donate offline can mail checks or money orders to Greater Atlanta Vedic Temple, 492 Harmony Grove Rd, Lilburn, GA, 30047, with a notation to apply the donation to the Help for Nepalese fund.</p>

<p>“The inspiration for this play came from the workshop I attended to produce it.

<p>The “Go Back, Move Ahead” Adult Learner Workshop is part of a statewide effort to get former students to complete their degrees. The program will begin at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, April 25, in the CN building, 555 N. Indian Creek Road, Clarkston, Ga.</p>
<p> The free information session includes a panel of GPC representatives who can discuss and answer questions about many topics, including:</p>
<p>—What it takes to be admitted</p>
<p>—How to apply for financial aid</p>
<p>—What to expect in a classroom</p>
<p>GPC’s program is part of a statewide campaign by Gov. Nathan Deal to encourage the more than 1 million Georgians who have completed some college to return and finish their degrees. “Go Back. Move Ahead" provides resources for prospective students and makes it easier for Georgians who have started college to go back to school and earn a degree or certificate.</p>
<p>“Go Back. Move Ahead” is part of the state’s “Complete College Georgia” initiative, which launched in 2011. It is projected that by 2020, more than 60 percent of jobs in Georgia will require a college certificate or degree. Presently, however, only 42 percent of the state’s young adults have earned a college credential—creating a need for an additional 250,000 graduates.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Does the end result of greater scientific knowledge justify the means used to get there? That’s the question implied during Georgia Perimeter College’s Theatre Arts Guild production “An Experiment with an Air Pump,” which opens this weekend.</p>
<p>Written by playwright Shelagh Stephenson, the play deals with scientific discovery and how scientists in two different centuries handle the ethical challenges they face during their scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>[The play] “offers a whole series of moral problems across two centuries, for it is simultaneously set in the same room at the end of 1799 and the end of 1999, switching from one date to the other as New Year’s Eve approaches,” says Sally Robertson, GPC theatre professor and the play’s director. “The simultaneous staging of similarity and difference, past and present, light and dark results in a drama that grapples with issues of ethics and belief and requires its audience to do the same. This is a play that gathers momentum as a drama and poses questions that each person must answer for themselves.”</p>
<p>Following the April 19 show, Robertson, along with nursing instructor Debra Gogatz and physics and astronomy professor Dr. Jim Guinn, will lead a discussion of the ethics of the science presented in the play.</p>
<p>Shows are 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, April 10-11 and April 17-18 and 3 p.m. on Sundays, April 12 and 19.</p>
<p>The play is suggested for teens 16 and older. Neither children nor infants will be admitted. It will be presented on stage in studio seating in the Cole Auditorium in the Clarkston Campus Fine Arts Building, located at 555 N. Indian Creek Road, Clarkston. Reservations are strongly suggested.</p>
<p>General admission tickets are $15 or free with GPC ID. For tickets, call 678-891-3572, or go to <a href="mailto:gpctagtx@gpc.edu">gpctagtx@gpc.edu</a>.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Dystopian themes in works like “The Hunger Games,” “Divergent” and “The Maze Runner” portray dark, dehumanizing and terrifying possibilities for the future of humanity.</p>
<p>In an upcoming lecture, Georgia Perimeter College professors Hank Eidson and Dr. Eric Morton will explore why these dystopian worlds have become a major part of our popular culture over the past few years. They’ll also delve into why the idea of a dystopian future continues to strongly fascinate audiences today.</p>
<p>Georgia Perimeter’s Sarah Larson Lecture Series will host the “Dystopian Futures Now: Anxiety in an Age of Uncertainty” event on Thursday, April 9, from 1 to 2:15 p.m. on the college’s Dunwoody Campus.</p>
<p>Eidson is an associate professor of English at GPC, where he has taught for more than 20 years. He completed his master’s at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and continued his English studies in the doctoral program at Georgia State University. Due to the overwhelming popularity of young adult novels focused on dystopian futures, Eidson has been examining how these examples of popular culture can shape the expectations and thoughts of readers and viewers who watch and read the genre.</p>
<p>Morton is a GPC assistant professor of philosophy. He completed his Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins University and joined the Georgia Perimeter faculty in 2010. Morton’s research focuses on naturalistic, anti-foundationalist epistemological approaches, as well as select figures from the history of philosophy connected with dystopian futures.</p>
<p>The lecture is free and open to the public in the GPC-Dunwoody auditorium, 2101 Womack Road, NC building, room 1100.</p>

<p>DECA, a joint venture between Georgia Perimeter College and the DeKalb County School District, is one of ten such programs operating across Georgia and will graduate its sixth and largest class yet this May.</p>
<p>“We have 86 graduates in the class of 2015,” says program coordinator Kathryn Hall. “Thirty of those students are on track to earn their associates from GPC, and all 30 will participate in GPC’s commencement ceremony." </p>
<p>DECA enables college-ready high school students from underrepresented groups to spend their first two years of high school at the academy in Stone Mountain and their final two at Georgia Perimeter’s Clarkston Campus.</p>
<p>Academy students earn high school and college credits simultaneously through dual enrollment. This means they can graduate from high school and earn a college associate degree at the same time. <a href="http://www.jff.org/sites/default/files/ECHS one pager STATS 2014.pdf">Statistics</a> found at the Jobs for the Future website show early college graduates enroll in college at a higher rate than non-early college students.</p>
<p>Hall notes that DECA receives continual aid enabling direct support to help students succeed. For example, she cites the $1 million Fitzgerald Foundation grant that Georgia Perimeter received last year for various GPC student success initiatives.</p>
<p>“Through the Fitzgerald Foundation, DECA offers tutorial time five days a week in economics, chemistry, biology, math, English and social science and runs a summer college boot camps for rising DECA 11th graders who will be enrolled at GPC in the fall,” Hall says.</p>
<p>Georgia Perimeter will celebrate Early High School College Week by hosting 10th graders on campus for a “Taste of GPC.” They'll take their COMPASS college entrance exams this week and then sit it on a college class.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Natural resource and sustainability issues will be hot topics during The Green Expo scheduled for Monday, April 6, from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Georgia Perimeter College’s Alpharetta Campus.</p>
<p>Presenters and participants are asked to ponder the conference theme: “What is the greatest environmental problem of the 21st century and what is your solution?”</p>
<p>The event, spearheaded by students in the Environmentally Green Organization (EGO), is open to public.</p>
<p>“There are all kinds of events and celebrations of different sorts but none for the environment,” laments Georgia Perimeter student Alex Gordon. “This is a gathering of local professionals and experts from sustainability and natural science fields collaborating to share information, network and demonstrate their practices and to carry out the necessary change for the future.”</p>
<p>Organizers have appealed to those manning expo booths and leading presentations to create activities that are “fun and interactive” for participants. Lunch also will be provided.</p>
<p>Additional <a href="http://alpharettasego.weebly.com/green-expo-at-gpc-april-2015.html" target="_blank">information and registration</a> is on the EGO website. GPC’s Alpharetta Campus is located at 3705 Brookside Parkway.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Georgia state Rep. Pedro “Pete” Marin will visit Georgia Perimeter College Thursday, March 26, to discuss changes to the laws governing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA). </p>
<p>Georgia Perimeter’s Latino Connection Club and the GPC Educational Achievement Program (GEAP) will sponsor the “DACA and DAPA Executive Action Forum and Info Session” at the college’s Dunwoody Campus, 2101 Womack Road, from 9-11 a.m. in NB 2100. GEAP is a retention program for Hispanic and Latino students.</p>
<p>“The forum is going to help our students understand how changes in the law are affecting them,” says Cathlene Cruz, GEAP project director.</p>
<p>Local attorney Charles Kuck also will be on hand to answer DACA and DAPA legal questions.</p>
<p>“We’re helping them understand their options,” Cruz says, while also noting some students are concerned about whether the pending consolidation of GPC and Georgia State University, along with their immigration status, could impact their ability to attend college. Cruz has been reassuring students that they will continue to be able to attend GPC, but this event will allow more dialogue about that topic.</p>
<p>The forum, supported by student government funds, is free and open to the public, as well as GPC students, faculty and staff. Latin-inspired food and drinks will be served.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Jennifer Thompson, co-author of the 2014-15 <a href="http://www.gpc.edu/gpcreads">GPC Reads</a> selection, “Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption,” is returning to Georgia Perimeter College March 18 for two talks.</p>
<p>Thompson will speak at 1 p.m. on Dunwoody Campus in NC-1100. That event will be followed by a student reception and book signing at 4:30 p.m. in the Fine Arts Auditorium on Clarkston Campus. Then, also at Clarkston, she will give a talk, followed by a question-and-answer session, at 7 p.m. in the Cole Auditorium.</p>
<p>“Picking Cotton” is about Thompson and Ronald Cotton, who was wrongly convicted of Thompson’s rape and served 11 years in prison. Thompson chose Cotton in a photo lineup, resulting in his wrongful incarceration until DNA evidence exonerated him. The two later became friends and collaborated on their book.</p>
<p>Other scheduled GPC Reads events include multiple screenings of the film, “Conviction: The Incredible True Story of Betty Anne Waters,” all at 1 p.m. on the following dates: March 25, NC-1100, Dunwoody Campus; March 26, SF-2100, Decatur Campus; and March 30, 2N-1100, Newton Campus.</p>
<p>Also scheduled is a March 31 visit by Aimee Maxwell, executive director of the Georgia Innocence Project, as part of the Newton Campus Daffodil Festival. The non-profit Innocence Project works on exonerating prisoners wrongfully incarcerated through DNA evidence.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>The Peach State Opera will stage Gaetano Donizetti’s “Elixir of Love” at Georgia Perimeter College on Sunday, March 1, at 3 p.m. in the Cole Auditorium on Clarkston Campus.</p>
<p>Opera connoisseur Carter Joseph will lead a 2 p.m. pre-show talk, similar to those he facilitates for The Atlanta Opera.</p>
<p>Peach State Opera, a touring company that serves small communities in Georgia and surrounding states, has enjoyed a long-standing relationship with Georgia Perimeter, including often partnering with faculty from the college’s vocal music department. Dr. Brian Bonin, head of vocal music at GPC, serves on the organization’s board of directors, while Georgia Perimeter’s former vocal music coordinator and current adjunct voice instructor Evelyn Hughes is the Peach State Opera conductor and artistic director.</p>
<p>“We want to build our audience at GPC,” says Nancy Martin, the opera’s publicity volunteer and a GPC Prime Time student. “We want to take the snootiness out of opera productions—the idea that it’s just for some people.”</p>
<p>“Elixir of Love” is described as an “operatic masterpiece of beguiling arias and intoxicating duets” on the Peach State Opera website. General admission tickets are $22 and only $5 for GPC faculty, staff and students. Visit <a href="http://peachstateopera.org/?page_id=20167">PeachStateOpera.org</a> to learn more about the production and to purchase tickets.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Beginning Jan. 26, Georgia Perimeter’s Student Health Services will become the clearinghouse for all student immunization records. Students will still be able to upload their immunization records online, but instead of doing so through the GPC Admissions site, they will be directed online to the Student Health Services secure site. The change will help keep up with student immunization compliance and keep all records in one place, says Patrice Smith, immunization coordinator for the  GPC Student Health Services. </p>
<p>Students are required to have up-to-date vaccination records if they were born after 1956. The vaccines are for MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella), Varicella (Chickenpox) and Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis).  Students 18 years old and under are required to have  the Hepatitis B series of immunizations.  Students born before 1980 do not have to have proof of a varicella shot, but titers are available at the student health clinic, which can indicate whether you had chickenpox as a child, says Smith.</p>
<p>Students can receive immunizations at the Student Health Centers at both Clarkston and Dunwoody campuses or at the mobile health clinic. Immunization fees vary, but student health services visits are free. </p>
<p>Contact Smith at 678-891-3866 or visit the <a href="http://depts.gpc.edu/immunizations/">immunization website</a> for more information on submitting, updating or receiving necessary immunizations.</p>

<p>Contributions, so far, are nearing the halfway mark for the campaign’s $75,000 goal.</p>
<p>Although the campaign officially ends Dec. 31, Erica Hart, Institutional Advancement, says pledges will be accepted after the first of the year and beyond.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to get as many pledges as possible committed by the end of this month, but we absolutely welcome donations of any amount at anytime,” Hart says. “Already, a number of participants have contributed with consideration for our Pledge $5 initiative, where we asked people to consider pledging five bucks on a monthly basis.”</p>
<p>Monies contributed through one-time gifts or monthly payroll deductions support student scholarships, in addition to faculty/staff development and academic programs. Patrons also are able to designate their gift to a specific department or scholarship program.</p>
<p>“However or whatever you choose to give, just know that your gift will make a difference at GPC,” Hart says.</p>
<p>Individuals can <a href="http://giving.gpc.edu/facultystaffcampaign">pledge online</a> or by filling out and returning the gift forms delivered via mail.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Georgia Perimeter College has been named a “Best for Vets College” by Military Times. GPC was among 140 colleges nationwide achieving this distinction.</p>
<p>“Best for Vets: Colleges 2015” is an editorially independent news project that evaluates the many factors that make an organization a good fit for service members, military veterans and their families.</p>
<p>Mark Eister, GPC's Military Outreach director, was pleased by the ranking. “Our goal is to offer our student veterans ‘A to Z’ assistance, from the first time they call or visit inquiring about the college, to preparing to graduate GPC.  We are here to help them apply for and use their VA benefits, advise them on what program of study and courses they should take, get tutoring help, assist them in searching and applying for a job – you name it.  We’re here to help them with whatever they need to be successful, both inside and outside the classroom."</p>
<p>In its fifth year, the ranking is the most comprehensive school-by-school assessment of veteran and military students’ success rates. The Best for Vets survey requires schools to meticulously document an array of services, special rules, accommodations and financial incentives offered to military and veteran students and to describe many aspects of veteran culture on a campus.</p>
<p>“We factor in what is, to our knowledge, the most detailed school-by-school data on veteran students’ academic success anywhere, including graduation, retention, persistence and course completion rates,” says Amanda Miller, editor of Bets for Vets. Two years ago, only 11 percent of the hundreds of schools surveyed could provide that level of detail. This year, that figure is up to 45 percent. “By recognizing only the schools that do the most, we believe we’re helping to raise the bar in veteran student services.”</p>

<p>“Bringing a New Business to Life” is being held in conjunction with National Entrepreneurship Week this Friday, Nov. 7, from 8 a.m. to noon at Dunwoody Campus, NC 1100.</p>
<p>The event kicks off with registration and continental breakfast and includes a success story presentation from young entrepreneur Josh Austin Sr., director of engineering for Ionic Security and founder of MaaSive.net software development company.</p>
<p>Georgia attorney John Sours, administrator for the Governor’s Office of Consumer Protection, will provide insight on unfair and deceptive business practices and offer advice to new and prospective business owners.</p>
<p>“We have two very dynamic speakers, each coming from very different aspects of the business world—one as a business professional with legal perspectives and the other as a successful business owner and manager,” says Ellie Shaw, event coordinator.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 participants already have signed up for “Bringing a New Life to Business,” which is sponsored by the Dunwoody Business Club and Alpha Beta Gamma. Shaw believes students in particular are drawn to the idea of being able to control their financial destiny, especially during periods of economic volatility.</p>
<p>“The information presented gives them knowledge and ideas to explore, and raises new questions that can be researched, in order to make better decisions for their future career track,” she says.</p>
<p>Seminar reservations are required. Students can sign up in a business class or by visiting NE 2408 at Dunwoody Campus. Faculty, staff and students can register by contacting Ellie Shaw at <a href="mailto:Elspeth.Shaw@gpc.edu">Elspeth.Shaw@gpc.edu</a>. The registration deadline is Thursday, Nov. 6, at noon.L</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Dr. Kathryn Crowther and Paul Boshears will discuss two contemporary popular interests, steampunk and zombies, Oct. 30 at Georgia Perimeter as part of the college’s Sarah Larson Lecture Series.</p>
<p>Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction dealing with 19th-century societies dominated by historical or imagined steam-powered technology.</p>
<p>The lecture, “Steampunk and Zombies: What Makes Pop Culture Popular?” is free and open to the public and will take place from 1 to 2:15 p.m. in the Dunwoody Campus auditorium, NC1100, 2101 Womack Road.</p>
<p>Crowther and Boshears will answer questions such as: “What puts the ‘pop’ in pop-culture?” “Why do steampunks wear brass goggles?” and “Why is ‘The Walking Dead’ set in Atlanta?” The lecture will explore what popular trends in television, film and performance culture “cos-play” might tell us about contemporary issues and concerns. A question-and-answer session will follow.</p>
<p>Crowther is an English professor at Georgia Perimeter. She earned her Ph.D. from Emory University where she specialized in Victorian novels and nineteenth-century print culture. She has done research on steampunk and disability studies and has a forthcoming essay on representations of disability and prosthetics in steampunk.</p>
<p>Boshears is co-founder of the journal <a href="http://www.continentcontinent.cc/index.php/continent/index">continent.</a> He is an Americorps VISTA alumnus and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. at the European Graduate School in Switzerland. His recent publications include an analysis of zombies in contemporary American society.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>A Georgia Perimeter College nursing graduate  and a nursing faculty member are among a small group traveling to Venezuela Oct. 18 to provide healthcare assistance at a medical clinic.</p>
<p>Along with their luggage, the nurses are bringing boxes of donated items—from tongue depressors to disinfecting wipes—collected through GPC’s nursing students, faculty and friends.</p>
<p>Catherine Norton, who graduated from GPC’s nursing program in 2012, and GPC professor Jeanette Crawford will bring their medical expertise to a new clinic in Barquisimeto in northern Venezuela. The two will work at the clinic for a week before returning to Atlanta.</p>
<p>Norton, a nurse in the medical telemetry department at Gwinnett Medical Center,  is co-founder of the nonprofit Christian group,<a href="http://www.identifythemission.org/"> Identify the Mission</a>. Crawford specializes in mental health nursing and will be working with a local psychologist at the clinic.</p>
<p>Currently, one of the Barquisimeto clinic’s most urgent needs is acetaminophen to tackle the country’s rampant Dengue fever, says Norton. The mosquito-borne illness creates flu-like symptoms and is “very hard on the elderly and small children,” she says. The clinic does not have access to the fever-reducing drug—and many other needed everyday items—due to political unrest in the country. There is no vaccine against the illness.</p>
<p>Through her Identify organization, Norton is seeking partnerships for healthcare service-learning opportunities for GPC nursing students in Central and South America.  </p>
<p>“I received the best nursing education at GPC, and I want to support the school and its nursing students in any way I can,” she says.</p>
<p> Medical items are still being collected. For information, contact Crawford at <a href="mailto:Jeanette.crawford@gpc.edu">Jeanette.crawford@gpc.edu</a>.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Georgia Perimeter students, faculty and staff participated in a first-ever event for the college on Oct. 7.</p>
<p>GPC’s Dunwoody Campus served as the host site for a national, satellite broadcast of inspirational speaker and former NBA player Stephen Bardo.</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="sites/newsroom.gpc.edu/files/field/image/Bardo%20Theodora.jpg" alt="Theodora Johnson and speaker Stephen Bardo" width="175" height="225" />“Mr. Bardo was excellent, he was energetic, insightful and motivational as our speaker; and most importantly he connected with the students—they loved him,” said Theodora Johnson, Dunwoody Student Life director.</p>
<p>Bardo spoke as part of The National Society of Leadership and Success’ National Broadcast Day series, which is available to students at its 434 member colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Johnson, faculty sponsor for the Dunwoody Campus Society of Leadership and Success, says hosting the event is a big honor for GPC since venues selected for the live broadcast are typically at larger schools.</p>
<p>“GPC Dunwoody had a packed house including both Mercer and DeVry campus faculty, staff and students,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Bardo’s career included stints with the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs and Detroit Pistons. He talked to Dunwoody attendees—and those tuning in via satellite—about leadership and overcoming adversity. He then took questions from the audiences and signed copies of his leadership book.</p>
<p>The National Society of Leadership and Success—with nearly 40 Georgia chapters—has been around for 13 years, with the goal of shaping college students for leadership roles throughout their lives. Johnson calls the organization an exceptional leadership opportunity for the students. </p>
<p> “Each student member is encouraged to bring something to the table in terms of how they personally want to change, grow or gain leadership skills,” she said. “So it is ideally supposed to be a personal growth opportunity for each participating member.”</p>
<p>Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post is among the remaining broadcast series speakers. GPC students will be able to participate in that and other presentations via satellite.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>You may have seen the signs around campus: “GPC is Tobacco Free.”</p>
<p>Now Georgia Perimeter College’s tobacco-free policy is taking shape. The policy, which bans all forms of tobacco products, becomes active Oct. 1.</p>
<p>The college executive team moved to align their Tobacco and Smoke-Free Campus policy with the University System of Georgia’s policy, which bans all forms of tobacco products on campus property.</p>
<p>GPC’s policy now states:<em> </em>“The use of all forms of tobacco products on property owned, leased, rented, in the possession of, or in any way used by Georgia Perimeter College is expressly prohibited. ‘Tobacco Products’ is defined as cigarettes, cigars, pipes, all forms of smokeless tobacco, clove cigarettes and any other smoking devices that use tobacco, such as hookahs, or simulate the use of tobacco such as electronic cigarettes.”</p>
<p>There will be a six-month grace period during which Public Safety officials will issue warnings to repeat offenders. After April 1, 2015, individuals not abiding by the policy will receive a warning for their first offense, a $10 fine for their second offense, a $20 fine for their third offense, and a fine plus disciplinary action from their campus student dean or department supervisor after the fourth offense.</p>
<p>An integral component of implementing the tobacco-free policy is the inclusion of tobacco cessation programs, says Julius Whitaker, who is overseeing the project at GPC.</p>
<p>Georgia Perimeter is offering a variety of tobacco cessation programs free of charge to students and employees through the GPC Student Health Clinics. They include low-cost and free nicotine patch, gum and lozenge replacement products. Prescription medications, including Bupropion SR generic (Zyban) and Varenicline (Chantix), are available through the Student Health Center for students with an appointment.   </p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://depts.gpc.edu/~gpcshc/services.htm">Student Health Center</a> site for a full list of tobacco-cessation programs and services. Additional information on smoking cessation can be found on the <a href="http://www.gpc.edu/tobaccofreegpc/">Tobacco Free GPC </a>website.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Georgia Perimeter College has named Dr. John Clower as interim vice president of Student Affairs and Enrollment Services. Clower temporarily replaces Dr. Vincent June, who was named a 2014-15 ACE Fellow and will be stationed for the academic year at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p>Prior to coming to GPC, Clower served as vice president of student affairs at North Georgia College and State University from 2007-11. He also was director of residence life and student judicial affairs at the University of West Georgia for more than 17 years.</p>
<p>A Smyrna, Ga. native, Clower received his undergraduate degree in biology at North Georgia College (now University of North Georgia), his master’s in Student Personnel Services at Northwestern State University of Louisiana and his doctorate in Higher Ed Administration from Florida State University.</p>
<p>While Clower directed residence life at West Georgia, he says there are “more challenges” for a college without student housing like GPC. “You don’t have a ‘captive’ audience 24/7 like you do with a residential college,” he says. “But student affairs is so much more than housing—we’re all educators. We’re trying to enrich student lives through programming and activities outside the classroom.”</p>
<p>The enrollment services team also will report to Clower. “At this point I am learning a great deal about the unique challenges GPC faces in this area. I look forward to working with the ERS team as we continue to improve services in that area.”</p>

The Beatles landed in New York City for their first U.S. tour. And the DeKalb Board of Education officially opened DeKalb College, the first and only public two-year college in the state controlled by a local school district.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years later, DeKalb College joined the University System of Georgia; and in 1997, the USG Board of Regents changed the name of the college to Georgia Perimeter College to reflect its expanding mission and its service throughout the metro Atlanta area. The GPC moniker became official in the fall of 1998.</p>
<p>Today, Georgia Perimeter has five campuses—Alpharetta, Clarkston, Decatur, Dunwoody and Newton County—plus the state university system’s largest online program. GPC currently serves more than 21,000 students and during its history has helped more than 350,000 students toward their dream of earning a college degree.</p>
<p>On Friday, Sept. 5, at 10:30 a.m., GPC faculty, staff and retirees will kick off the college’s 50th anniversary celebration at Fall Convocation in the Clarkston Campus gymnasium. Special guest speaker will be Dr. Houston Davis, USG executive vice chancellor. Interim President Rob Watts will give the annual state-of-the-college address, and Academic Affairs Vice President Ron Stark will provide a college update. </p>
<p>The business part of the day will be followed by a picnic.

<p>Fitzgerald-funded scholarships enabled nine DECA students to attend summer school at Georgia Perimeter and move toward graduating from high school and college simultaneously. </p>
<p>Award recipient Blaine Allen Jr. is an aspiring lawyer. “My plan for achieving the associate’s degree in criminal justice is becoming more and more of a reality with each course that I take and successfully pass,” Allen says.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald scholarship covered tuition and fees for students taking summer classes online or face-to-face on Clarkston Campus. DECA students normally take college classes only during the academic year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Fitzgerald Foundation awarded GPC its first $1 million private gift as part of an ambitious plan to increase access and boost retention, transfer and graduation rates among some of the state’s most underserved students.</p>
<p>DECA, a joint venture between GPC and the DeKalb County School District, enables college-ready high school students from underrepresented groups to spend their first two years of high school at the academy in Stone Mountain and their final two at Georgia Perimeter’s Clarkston Campus.</p>
<p>“Grades officially come out on July 28, but many students have reported that they did very well in their summer classes,” says Kathryn Hall, DECA director.</p>

Program Math Academy this spring.  The academy—sponsored through a $1 million gift from the Betty and Davis Fitzgerald Foundation—enrolled 72 participants who had fallen shy of passing the math portion of the Compass entrance exam.</p>
<p>After eight weeks of one-on-one, intensive math instruction and tutoring on the Clarkston, Decatur and Dunwoody campuses, the potential students had the opportunity to re-take the Compass and gain admission to GPC. Of the 59 participants re-testing, well over half—63 percent—passed.</p>
<p>“Most of the students that completed the spring math academy and then passed the Compass, will enroll for the fall,” says Marian Adomakoh, Advising, Counseling and Retention Services, Clarkston.</p>
<p>A post survey revealed that all of the participants rated their math skills as ‘weak’ or ‘very weak’ upon beginning the tutoring and instruction program, while the vast majority described their math skills as ‘good’ or ‘very good’ after participating in the eight-week academy.</p>
<p>According to one participant: “It helped me get a basic understanding of college math in a short time.”</p>
<p>“We’re so pleased with the program’s effectiveness, given students’ reported rate of improvement in their math skills,” Adomakoh says. “While all the participants rated their math skills as weak prior to the academy, 80 percent stated their skills improved as a result of attending the spring Math Academy.”</p>

<p>Participating students drafted colorful messages on t-shirts, which were then displayed on “clotheslines” and in buildings.  </p>
<p>Students in Dr. Dana Wiggins’ Women in American History class coordinated the activity, asking participants who had experienced violence, or knew a woman who had, to decorate shirts.</p>
<p>“We then displayed the shirts as visible symbols of the number of women who have experienced domestic, sexual or sexuality-related violence,” Wiggins says. “This project lends itself to the goals of the class and feminism in general by giving women survivors voices and also allowing volunteers to work with activism outside of the classroom.”</p>

<p>The office recently undertook an audit to better understand all the ways in which it supports the college, according to Barbara Obrentz, director of the office, which will now go by the acronym MarCom.</p>
<p>“What we discovered was that we create so much more than media releases,” says Obrentz. “We produce speeches; write departmental video scripts; design invitations, posters, flyers, brochures and logos; plan and promote events; design advertising campaigns, and work with others to promote the college on social media -- plus so much more.” </p>
<p>The name Marketing and Communications is more representative of the office’s functions, she says.</p>

Out of five possible stars, American School Search gave GPC 4 ½, or a B+ rating, based on crime and safety information compiled from data released by the United States Department of Education for 2012.</p>
<p>Specifically, the report analyzes categories of violent and non-violent crimes committed both on-campus and off-campus over the last three years at all GPC campuses.</p>
<p>While Georgia Perimeter Public Safety Director Nicholas Marinelli Jr. is pleased with the favorable ranking, the public safety team will strive to improve that ranking. </p>
<p>“The mission of the GPC Public Safety Department is to provide a safe and secure learning and workplace environment for our students, faculty, staff and visitors through a strategically trained, tactically equipped, fully staffed public safety department,” Marinelli says.</p>

<p>The Texas-based NISOD Excellence Awards recognize college professors each year who have demonstrated an outstanding commitment and contribution to their students and colleagues.</p>
<p>“Recognizing those individuals who have contributed to student success and their colleges’ mission is something we look forward to doing each year,” says Dr. Edward Leach, NISOD’s director. “The extraordinary work of these men and women includes not only what they do for their students and colleagues, but what they do for the communities in which they live and work. We’re honored to be able to play a part in celebrating their achievements.”</p>
<p>Created in 1978, NISOD is a consortium of community and technical colleges that share a commitment to supporting excellence in teaching, learning, and leadership.</p>

<p>DECA, a joint venture between GPC and the DeKalb County School District, enables college-ready high school students from underrepresented groups to spend their first two years of high school at the academy in Stone Mountain and their final two at Georgia Perimeter's Clarkston Campus. Academy students earn high school and college credits simultaneously through dual enrollment, which means they can graduate from high school and college simultaneously.</p>
<p>Ghebre and Pitter are graduating May 12 from Georgia Perimeter and will earn their high school diplomas in addition to their associate degree. Pitter has been accepted to Georgia State University, and Ghebre will transfer to Georgia Tech.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>Two Georgia Perimeter College employees are guiding a segment of the University System of Georgia’s <a href="http://www.usg.edu/educational_access/complete_college_georgia">Complete College Georgia</a> efforts. Elizabeth Thornton, a GPC English professor, and Dr. Matthew Robison, Clarkston Campus dean of students, are leading the state’s regional meetings and conference for <a href="http://www.15tofinishgeorgia.com/">"15 to Finish"</a> Feb. 21 through March 21.</p>
<p>The meetings, which are open to USG faculty, advisors and administrators, are being held at Georgia Southwestern State University, Middle Georgia State College, University of North Georgia and Georgia State University.</p>
<p>Designed to encourage graduation in four years, “15 to Finish” promotes a 15-credit per semester academic load for students. It is a component of Complete College Georgia designed to retain, promote and graduate students.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the emphasis on taking at least 15 credit hours per semester has faded, says Thornton. Many students take only 12 credits, the required amount to receive federal financial aid. “We want to change the norm,” she says.</p>
<p>Helping students identify their majors early on is one of the objectives of the program, says Robison. Many times, students take a collection of courses that don’t apply to a specific major, Robison says. “They often exhaust their financial aid and then incur serious debt in student loans—and to top it off, don’t graduate.”</p>
<p>Program of study “maps,” earlier academic advising and the statewide Degree Works software course-tracking program are all components of “15 to Finish.”</p>
<p>Both Robison and Thornton note that not all components of “15 to Finish” will work for the part-time students who make up a large portion of the student body at GPC and other commuter-heavy institutions.</p>
