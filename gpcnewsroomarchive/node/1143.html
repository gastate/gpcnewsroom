GPC student volunteers also got a special thanks listing along with the sponsors in the program. Jill Patrick, managing artistic director of the Working Title Playwrights, said the event was “the most winning 24 HR Plays we’ve hosted since the first one six years ago. Because of GPC’s Drama Club help, it was definitely the most smoothly run.”</p>
