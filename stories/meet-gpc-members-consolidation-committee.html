          <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>Twenty-one members of Georgia Perimeter College’s faculty, staff and students will serve on the GPC/Georgia State Consolidation Implementation Committee, bringing a wide array of experience to their important task. They are joined by 21 members from Georgia State University.</p>
<p>Chosen for their leadership capabilities and proven track record to “get the job done,” the group will provide overall leadership to support the implementation effort. One of their major tasks will be leading the many onsite sub-committees that will be working out details of how the consolidated institution will operate.</p>
<p>University System of Georgia Chancellor Hank Huckaby appointed the 42-member Consolidation Implementation Committee following the January approval by the USG Board of Regents to consolidate the two colleges. He has charged committee members with assessing the needs and infrastructure of the new consolidated institution and providing recommendations regarding campus structure, programs and locations. </p>
<p> GPC’s team members sent to the Newsroom their goals for the consolidation, as well as brief bios. They are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img style="float: left; margin: 5px;" src="../sites/newsroom.gpc.edu/files/field/image/India%20Blackburn%201.jpg" alt="India Blackburn" width="150" height="200" />India Blackburn, </strong><em>assistant dean, student services, Alpharetta Campus</em></p>

<p><strong>Consolidation goal: “</strong>The students are our first priority. We have a great opportunity to expand access while improving rates of student success by providing increased flexibility of course offerings, high quality programs and services. I look forward to working with our colleagues at GSU to create a prodigious new institution for the state of Georgia.”</p>
