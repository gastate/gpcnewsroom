      Q&amp;A on Ga. State and Ga. Perimeter consolidation    </h1>
    
    
    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
    <div class="field-items">
          <div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p><em>(story updated Feb. 24, 2015)</em></p>
<p>The news of the planned consolidation of Georgia Perimeter College and Georgia State University has elicited many questions. While some questions were answered during the Jan. 13 town hall meetings at GPC and Georgia State, there are many questions that can’t be answered until the consolidation implementation committee and work groups move forward with their assignments. </p>
<p>The following is a compilation of faculty, staff and students’ questions that can be addressed currently. The GPC Newsroom will continue to post answers to questions as we get them. Please check the GPC Newsroom for updates. More information also will be available at the official consolidation web site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="xmsonormal"><strong>Will GPC be able to continue filling positions that become open due to retirements or people resigning current positions during the consolidation process? </strong></p>
<p class="xmsonormal">That decision will be made based upon the position. We are now continuing to post, interview and fill a number of open positions, and the decision on future positions that open up will be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What happens if the consolidation is not approved by SACS?</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">The following response is from Dr. Susan Finazzo, Georgia Perimeter College's d</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">ean of Institutional Effectiveness and also GPC's liaison with </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC):  </span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Although I do not speak for the <a href="http://www.sacscoc.org/">SACSCOC </a></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Board of Trustees or the Commission, I think denial of the consolidation is unlikely. This will be the sixth such consolidation within the University System of Georgia, and all of the previous consolidations have been approved. We have a proven track record in this regard, and there is no reason to think we will be denied.</span></span></p>
<p>The SACSCOC Board of Trustees is composed of representatives from the various member institutions. The board members certainly understand the landscape of higher education. When the Board meets in December it can take only one of two actions with regard to our prospectus; it will either approve or deny the prospectus. In the unlikely event the prospectus is denied the colleges can resubmit a new prospectus for consideration. The Board also has the latitude to comment on both approved and denied prospectuses. Both GPC and GSU would retain their <a href="http://www.sacscoc.org/pdf/webmemlist.pdf">existing accreditation </a>during this period.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will this consolidation affect TAG students? Will TAG agreements still be honored?</strong></p>
<p>According to Georgia Perimeter College President Rob Watts and to Georgia State University President Dr. Mark Becker, GPC’s current transfer admission guarantee programs with other institutions should not be affected. Students will not lose opportunities to transfer to other institutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will the GPC Alumni Association be active and recognized after the consolidation?</strong></p>
<p>According to Collins Foster, GPC’s alumni director, “At this time it is unknown whether the two organizations will be consolidated into one alumni association serving the combined alumni base. Alumni activities will continue as planned for both organizations throughout the consolidation process. GPC’s 50th Anniversary Celebration will continue as planned honoring the rich history of the college and its alumni since 1964.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Who will be president of the new university and what will it be called?</strong></p>
<p class="body">Georgia State President Dr. Mark Becker will serve as president. The consolidated institution will keep the name Georgia State University.</p>
<p class="body"> </p>
<p><strong>What was the driving purpose of the consolidation?</strong></p>
<p>Shelley Nickel, vice chancellor for planning and implementation with the University System of Georgia Board of Regents: “We have said all along that we will be considering more consolidations. Consolidating the two institutions will help us improve student success by expanding access, applying best-practice programs and reinvesting savings into academics for the benefit of our students.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Will Georgia Perimeter maintain its access mission? </strong></p>
<p class="body">Yes. GPC interim President Rob Watts:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> “</span>We will not lose the access mission in this consolidation. We will continue to serve the kind of students that we have always served.” Nickel: “The Board of Regents is also committed to preserving the access mission.”</p>
<p class="body"> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Will the consolidation change admission requirements for GPC students?</strong></p>
<p class="body">There likely will be two tiers of admission requirements, for associate-degree-seeking students at the access (GPC) campuses and for baccalaureate-degree-seeking students at the downtown campus. Watts: “I would not expect them to be much different than they are now.”</p>
<p class="body"> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Will GPC students’ tuition and fees go up to what Georgia State students pay?</strong></p>
<p class="body">A two-tiered system with the associate-degree students paying lower fees and tuition amounts is planned. This is what happened with Gainesville State College, an access institution, when it consolidated with North Georgia University recently. The USG Board of Regents and chancellor have continually stated their commitment to keeping college affordable.</p>
<p class="body"> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Will the smaller class sizes at GPC change?</strong></p>
<p class="body">The college expects to maintain small class sizes following the transition, as smaller classes are an integral part of the access mission. Also, GPC campuses have very few spaces that could accommodate large classes. </p>
<p class="body"> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Can an associate-degree student attend classes downtown and vice versa?</strong></p>
<p class="body">No. The downtown Georgia State campus will continue to serve baccalaureate, master’s and doctoral students, while the GPC access campuses will serve associate-degree students. There may, however, be some crossover with online classes. GPC currently has the largest online program in the University System.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will GSU four-year degrees be available to GPC students?</strong></p>
<p>Students wishing to obtain a four-year degree will have to apply and be accepted into GSU’s baccalaureate track. GPC will continue to offer associate degrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why was GPC selected for consolidation over Atlanta Metro State University?</strong></p>
<p>According to the Board of Regents, “the Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter consolidation presents an opportunity to create a modern, urban university that balances the needs for access as well as research and public service.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will GPC department leaders be able to meet up with their GSU counterparts?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Department chairs and administrators have encouraged their faculty and staff to reach out to their counterparts at Georgia State.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Will there be layoffs?</strong></p>
<p>A decrease in the number of jobs will likely occur. However, until details are worked out, it is not possible to know how many or which ones. Certain administrative functions will be combined, resulting in the need for fewer positions over time.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens to athletics next year and after that?</strong></p>
<p>Georgia Perimeter has suspended recruitment for its athletic teams. GPC will continue its regular spring season schedule for all spring sports, but that likely will be the last time GPC Jaguar teams play. Athletes on scholarship have been given the opportunity to keep their scholarships through their eligibility if they choose to stay at GPC. If they choose to leave, they will get a release letter allowing them to play at another institution.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there a possibility that GPC athletics will remain in place?</strong></p>
<p>No. However, there is a possibility students will be able to try out for Georgia State teams.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will facilities be handled in this consolidation? </strong></p>
<p>The consolidation implementation team will be assessing the needs and infrastructure of the new consolidated institution. The consolidation team’s final report to the Board of Regents will include a recommendation about campus structures and locations. Nickel: “Data, student usage and community engagement all will go into this decision.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will the consolidation affect undocumented students?</strong></p>
<p>The current policy at each respective institution is not expected to change. GPC currently enrolls undocumented students (who pay out-of-state tuition), while Georgia State is one of five USG institutions that do not.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>As a GPC student, do I have to apply to be admitted to Georgia State’s baccalaureate program after graduation?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will have to apply as you do now. You may also apply to transfer to another four-year university.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Will continuing education courses be offered?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Georgia State offers a continuing education program. Admission is open to everyone. There are no educational prerequisites for most courses, and students are not required to send transcripts or take university entrance exams to enroll.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Will GPC keep its transfer articulation guarantees (TAGs)?</strong></p>
<p>Most likely. Becker has stated support for transfer articulation agreements with other four-year universities. “The goal is that the students, wherever they start, get the support to be successful, whether it is graduating [from GPC] with an associate degree, Georgia State with a bachelor degree or somewhere else. That is what we are in the business of doing,” he said.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Will the rank and tenure earned by faculty at GPC be honored at the new institution?</strong></p>
<p class="body">Nickel: <strong>“</strong>Historically, that is what we have done. We have not had any issues taking tenure away from anyone.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="body"><strong>Will salaries increase since we will be part of a research institution? </strong></p>
<p class="body">It’s unlikely. Becker: “The same question came up with North Georgia/Gainesville State [consolidation]. The answer is: the Gainesville State [access] mission is still the Gainesville State mission, and in general salaries did not change much, if at all.”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens to duplicate departments? </strong></p>
<p>Becker: “We will be looking at past models administratively … and considering how do you want to organize yourself—whether there are duplicate departments or campus-based faculty. But all the answers won’t be known until later in the process.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will any departments be merged?</strong></p>
<p>Nickel: “In previous consolidations, there have been opportunities for them (departments) to work together as one prior to the actual official consolidation. This has been done through a MOU (memorandum of understanding) where one leader becomes a defacto leader of that unit. … We do know that administrative systems like BANNER and financial aid will be merged.”</p>
