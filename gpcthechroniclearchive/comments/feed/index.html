		<description><![CDATA[Some of the details are a bit off, but it looks pretty awesome. GPC is on its way. I couldn’t have done it without Vice President Juanita Barr, Secretary Hedaya Othman, our brilliant Advisor Dr. Dion Stewart, and the Alpharetta Director of student life Marshonntri Reid. GPC has joined the mission to create sustainability and excellence. #join #Done-woody gets it done! #AlphaEGO #naturenerdlife]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Susan, 
You touched me in so many ways during my growing years at Dekalb College.  I found this article and wanted to reach out and say thank you.  My Great Gatsby paper was a disaster but your admonishment afterwards stayed with me for the rest of my life.
